# Jarvis - Python Virtual Assistant

A voice-controlled virtual assistant built using Python that executes commands like searching on Wikipedia, sending emails, playing music/movies, and interacting via voice using speech recognition and text-to-speech.

## 🚀 About Project

This project implements a **Python-based Virtual Assistant**, named **Jarvis**, capable of handling spoken commands and executing tasks like web browsing, sending emails, playing local media, and reporting time - all through **speech interaction**. It utilizes **Google Speech Recognition**, **pyttsx3** for TTS, and other Python libraries for functionality.
